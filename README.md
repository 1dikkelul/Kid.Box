ESP32 with a Cheap Yellow Display, a 40mm Speaker and some big colourfull buttons. 

It should show the weather, currently and prediction today (so my daughter stops asking me every morning)
It should try to wake the older daughter who sleeps like a hibernating bear (ignore the other one who gets up at 5-6am)
It should warn the kids when they should be getting dressed
It should somehow pull from our family calender to show what event(s) is on today

So far I only got WiFI working and the basic display lights up with Hello World. 
That last part took.....perhaps longer than it should... so using Github because if I go backwards or have to redo that I will...be upset
